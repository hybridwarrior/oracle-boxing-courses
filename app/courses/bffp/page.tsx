    {
      question: "Is this course suitable for complete beginners?",
      answer: "Absolutely! BFFP is designed to build your boxing knowledge from the ground up. We start with fundamental concepts and progress systematically. Many beginners prefer starting here because it prevents bad habits from forming."
    },
    {
      question: "How is BFFP different from the Boxing Roadmap?",
      answer: "BFFP focuses on the conceptual framework, theory, and 'why' behind boxing‚Äîcovering mind, body mechanics, tactics, and conditioning. The Roadmap is the practical 'how-to' with specific drills and progressions. They complement each other perfectly (which is why we offer them in a bundle)."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to complete?",
      answer: "The course contains 150 lessons. Most students take 3-6 months working through it at their own pace. However, you have lifetime access, so you can revisit concepts as you progress."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need any equipment?",
      answer: "For the theory sections, no equipment is needed. For practice, basic equipment like gloves and a heavy bag is recommended but not required to understand the concepts."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get a refund if it's not for me?",
      answer: "Yes! We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with the course for any reason, just email us for a full refund."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this course updated with new content?",
      answer: "The core BFFP system is complete, but we occasionally add supplementary content and updates based on student feedback. All updates are free for existing students."
    },
    {
      question: "Will this help me in sparring?",
      answer: "Yes! BFFP gives you the mental framework, tactical understanding, and technical foundation that translates directly to sparring. Many students report significant improvements in their ring IQ and decision-making."
