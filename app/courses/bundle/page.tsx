    },
    {
      question: "Which course should I start with?",
      answer: "Most students start with BFFP to build the conceptual foundation, then move to Roadmap for practical drills, while using the Vault to supplement both. But you can start anywhere,they all work together."

    {
      question: "Is this better value than buying individually?",

    },
    {
      question: "Do I still get updates to all courses?",
      answer: "Yes! You get lifetime access to all current content plus any future updates to BFFP, Roadmap, and the Vault. New coaching call replays are added monthly to the Vault."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I already own one of the courses?",

      question: "Is there a payment plan available?",
