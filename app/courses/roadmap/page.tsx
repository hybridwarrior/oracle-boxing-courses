    {
      question: "How is the Roadmap different from BFFP?",
      answer: "The Roadmap is the practical 'how-to' with drills, progressions, and specific techniques organized into 5 phases. BFFP is the conceptual framework explaining the 'why' behind boxing‚Äîmind, body mechanics, and tactics. They complement each other perfectly."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to complete the phases in order?",
      answer: "Yes, the phases are designed to build on each other systematically. Skipping ahead can create gaps in your foundation. However, you can revisit earlier phases anytime to refine techniques."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should I spend on each phase?",
      answer: "Most students spend 2-4 weeks per phase, but it varies based on practice frequency and prior experience. Move to the next phase when you're comfortable with the current material‚Äîthere's no rush."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this if I'm already training at a gym?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Many gym members use the Roadmap to supplement their training, fill technical gaps, and have structured homework between sessions. It's designed to complement live coaching."
    },
    {
      question: "What equipment do I need?",
      answer: "Basic equipment is recommended: gloves, hand wraps, and a heavy bag. Some drills can be done shadow boxing, but a bag helps with applying power and timing."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this suitable for preparing for sparring?",
      answer: "Yes! The Roadmap is specifically designed to prepare you for sparring. By Phase V, you'll have the technical foundation and defensive skills needed to spar safely and effectively."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I get updates if new content is added?",
      answer: "Yes, all updates and improvements to the Roadmap are free for existing students. You have lifetime access to all current and future content."
