    {
      question: "How is the Roadmap different from BFFP?",

    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to finish the phases in order?",
      answer: "Yes. Each phase builds on the last one to teach you all the skills. You can go back to earlier phases anytime."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should I spend on each phase?",
      answer: "Most students spend 2 to 4 weeks per phase. It depends on how often you train. Take your time. Getting better is more important than rushing."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this if I train at a gym?",
      answer: "Yes. The Roadmap gives you a clear plan and homework to add to your gym training."
    },
    {
      question: "What do I need?",
      answer: "Gloves, hand wraps, and a heavy bag work best. But many drills can be done shadowboxing if you don't have a bag."
    },
    {
      question: "Will this help me get ready for sparring?",
      answer: "Yes. By Phase V, you'll be sharp with your moves, good at defense, and confident when things get tough."
