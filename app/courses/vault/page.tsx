      question: "How is this different from BFFP and Roadmap?",
      answer: "BFFP and Roadmap are structured courses. The Vault is a collection of live coaching call replays where Oliver & Toni answer real student questions. It's less structured but incredibly valuable for specific problems, troubleshooting, and seeing concepts applied in different contexts."
    },
    {
      question: "How often is new content added?",
      answer: "New replay sessions are added monthly. We hold weekly coaching calls, and the best ones (covering popular topics or unique insights) are added to the vault. You get access to all past and future replays."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I request specific topics?",
      answer: "While you don't get to submit questions directly (that's exclusive to active membership), many common topics have already been covered. We also prioritize adding replays on frequently requested subjects."
    },
    {
      question: "How long are the replay sessions?",
      answer: "Sessions vary from 20 minutes to 90 minutes depending on the topic. Most are 30-45 minutes of focused coaching on specific techniques or concepts."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this a replacement for BFFP or Roadmap?",
      answer: "No, it's a supplement. BFFP and Roadmap give you systematic frameworks. The Vault gives you real coaching insights, troubleshooting, and alternative explanations. Together, they're incredibly powerful."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I access older coaching call archives?",
      answer: "Yes! The vault includes all 2024-2025 replays from January through October, plus selected archives from the Boxing Clinic category. That's 140+ sessions and growing."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I want to ask my own questions live?",
      answer: "For live Q&A access, check out the Oracle Membership which includes weekly coaching calls where you can ask questions directly, plus access to all courses including the vault."
