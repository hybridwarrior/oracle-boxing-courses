        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          Oracle Boxing offers a 30-day money-back guarantee for digital course purchases bought by themselves. If you are not satisfied with your standalone course purchase for any reason, you can request a full refund within 30 days of purchaseâ€”no questions asked.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '18px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '24px', marginBottom: '12px' }}>What's NOT Covered by the Guarantee:</h3>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          The 30-day money-back guarantee does NOT apply to:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px', marginLeft: '20px' }}>
          <li><strong>Lifetime access upgrades</strong> added to course purchases</li>

        </ul>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>

        </p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '48px', marginBottom: '16px' }}>NO REFUNDS FOR MEMBERSHIPS</h2>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
          Oracle Boxing does NOT offer refunds for membership purchases under any circumstances.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '18px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '24px', marginBottom: '12px' }}>Memberships (No Refunds):</h3>
        <ul style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px', marginLeft: '20px' }}>

        </ul>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '18px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '24px', marginBottom: '12px' }}>Why No Refunds for Memberships?</h3>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          Oracle Boxing actively budgets and makes critical business decisions based on expected membership revenue. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px', marginLeft: '20px' }}>
          <li>Scheduling coaching calls and allocating coach time</li>
          <li>Planning community resources and support</li>
          <li>Maintaining platform infrastructure and services</li>
          <li>Making financial commitments to third-party services</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          Because we rely on membership revenue for operational planning, all membership payments are final and non-refundable.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '18px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '24px', marginBottom: '12px' }}>Your Responsibility to Cancel:</h3>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          <strong>It is your responsibility to cancel your membership before it renews if you do not wish to continue.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px', marginLeft: '20px' }}>
          <li>You can cancel your membership at any time by contacting team@oracleboxing.com</li>
          <li>Cancellations must be submitted BEFORE your next billing date to avoid being charged</li>
          <li>We will NOT refund membership payments if you forget to cancel before renewal</li>
          <li>Upon cancellation, you will retain access through the end of your current paid period</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          We send renewal reminders, but it remains your responsibility to manage your subscription and cancel if desired.
        </p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '48px', marginBottom: '16px' }}>NO REFUNDS FOR 1-ON-1 COACHING</h2>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          All 1-on-1 coaching purchases are final and non-refundable. Once you book and pay for coaching services, we reserve coach time specifically for you. No refunds will be issued for coaching services.
        </p>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          If you need to reschedule a coaching session, please contact us as soon as possible. We will work with you to find an alternative time, but we cannot guarantee availability and cannot offer refunds.
        </p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '48px', marginBottom: '16px' }}>6-WEEK CHALLENGE REFUND (DISCRETIONARY)</h2>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          The 6-Week Challenge operates under a different guarantee structure. Refund approval is determined at the sole discretion of Oracle Boxing Ltd.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '18px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '24px', marginBottom: '12px' }}>Completion Requirements:</h3>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          To be considered for a potential refund, participants should complete the following over the 6-week period:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px', marginLeft: '20px' }}>
          <li>Attend at least 2 live coaching calls per week (or watch the replays)</li>
          <li>Post at least 1 training video per week for feedback</li>

        </ul>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '18px', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '24px', marginBottom: '12px' }}>Discretionary Approval:</h3>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          Meeting the above requirements does not guarantee a refund. The final decision on whether a participant has "won" the challenge and qualifies for a refund is made entirely at Oracle Boxing Ltd's discretion.
        </p>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
          We reserve the right to approve or deny refund requests based on genuine participation, effort, and engagement with the program. This discretionary structure maintains the integrity of the challenge while rewarding authentic commitment.
        </p>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
