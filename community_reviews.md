"Doing pad work yesterday and multiple times the coach asked me what I've been doing as my balance and therefore power was noticeably improved - 100% down to applying all the learning from HWE!! Thank you everyone!"

"Thank you for the generous ego-boost! You're absolutely right - the training here is excellent! I wasn't expecting so much high-level of observation and precise, personal guidance from the coaches. I'm already noticing how making a few subtle changes can produce big results in energy conservation and effectiveness. It's pretty cool!"

"After this fight, I realized just how quickly and unexpectedly things can change, and the importance of adapting to whatever comes your way. This adaptability comes with experience; the more you train, the better you become at switching gears when necessary. It's also crucial to listen to your coaches' directions. Trusting their guidance is important because they see things you might not.

I feel immensely proud of all the hard work that led me to this moment, and I'm excited to continue my journey of sharpening my skills. I've learned so much from being in the ring; it truly is a great way to learn‚Äîlike being thrown into the fire!üî•

Once again, thank you so much to this community for your support. Special thanks to @Oliver Betts and @Antonio Troni for their guidance; it means a lot to me."

"I realised tonight that Toni's knowledge and experience are worth more than any drills you can do by yourself. I would strongly suggest everyone, if you only have time for one thing and a choice between doing some drills or hopping on a 1-1 with Toni or @Oliver Betts, you should always choose the call. You'll get expert knowledge and not only correct your technique but also receive some wisdom and motivation."

"I'll admit my mind was in a bad place before joining elite, and even a few times while being in elite when I had a few personal situations going on. You need to find a passion that you truly love and that you can truly set and reach goals for. For me it was boxing. Work tirelessly for those goals and become obsessed with hitting them. You need to be surrounded by people with likeminded goals/plans."

"Motivation comes from taking action, not the other way round. Notice how professional athletes train every single day, even if they don't feel like it? There is a good reason for that. Waiting for inspiration will take you nowhere. Discipline is the key to unlock those doors. Start taking action and watch your energy rising ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Oliver and Toni are experts in their field with a lot of wisdom and insight, and it's the only thing that matters. Look up to them for inspiration. This is something I'm guilty of, so I need to remind myself that this journey is my own. It's highly individual and intimate process although we're all in this together."

"My interest in this program is because it is the only one that focuses on Biomechanics. This the most important part of any movement. My experience has revealed that most of the boxing programs are not teaching the biomechanics of movement.

What I hope to learn is biomechanics of boxing and development of shadow boxing routines that children can do without the goal of sparring or competition. I would like to develop a form of boxing training more like a martial art than a sport to be able to impart in the youth a sense of confidence manifesting respect and etiquette through a projection of strength and tenacity."

"Excellent description of biomechanics found only here."

"Just finished 2nd kinetic chain with Toni. The analysis, insight and explanation was amazing. I've been around boxing for over 50 years and have never had this experience. This has worldwide implications for basic physical education for children. Start early rather than trying to undo old habits later.

This program is more than boxing. It's applied biomechanics that all people should be aware of. BEAUTIFUL program!"

"A great presentation, well presented - nice work! I'm in the process of shifting my current paradigm and this really helps by adding an additional layer of confluence for me that the shift is happening.

It also further confirms my decision to join HWE as it's exactly the path I've been on since I was traveling Asia at your age, but never fully stepped into, so great that you guys share this vision too. Makes me super excited to continue this journey with the team and community.

The perspective of viewing things from the light rather than the dark is such a great place to operate from. It is literally just a choice you can make and so powerful once enacted. It can feel tough to adjust to at first, but once you lean into it, it becomes natural and seemingly obvious."

"What I like about this, is that you, Jordan and Toni really seem to live this way, not just talk about it."

"Elite is like a new family to me. There are members here that I truly look up to and that helped me so much change my life around. Some members put me on a completely different path without even realizing. Others have helped me so so much that they too have shaped ways I think/see things.

This community surrounds me with good people who all have one goal, unlike the crowds I was with before joining elite. I think of specific things some members said to me everyday to help me keep going. I truly appreciate everyone in elite and you guys have all impacted my life greatly. I changed so much in elite, and I feel like I have to keep going to pay back the people who helped me, and to hopefully return that favor and help others.

Elite motivates me every single day to not only keep training, but to also just be a better human. It's impacted my life so much being here and I'm forever grateful."

"Thanks again to you guys, I just wanted to let you know, that I am right now shifting my old childish and beat-up soul which was fucked up by forced paradigms into my true self. 3 Times through your paradigm shift and spoon bending videos @Oliver Betts plus rewatching Matrix 1 and 2.

@Oliver Betts I think you safed my life! I am not sure right now how many things will change, but my mind completely changed for better! Again I was sure that I will learn here how to box, thats for sure!

But that I also would have my biggest change in life, I never imagined! Martial arts are fucking best :D love it!"

"I was genuinely happy to share my experience, and I'm always glad to help in any way I can. I truly appreciate your coaching and you as a person; your guidance has made a huge difference for me.

Being part of Hybrid Warrior Elite also makes me incredibly curious about what truly makes an online learning community like this a success. I appreciate the opportunity to see firsthand how you all pilot new ideas and pivot to make it even better."

"Again I need to say, it was the best choice of my current martial arts (and overall philosophical/real existing) life to join elite! I cannot say how often you gave me this aha-moments! Freaking awesome!
I feel like a child again, which slowly understands life more and more, and this with sweet 36 years haha :D"

"Being part of this community has been an incredibly transformative experience for me. Joining the live Zoom calls almost every day has not only helped me tweak and improve my technique, but it has also significantly boosted my confidence. The guidance, encouragement, and camaraderie I've experienced here has made all the difference in my development as a boxer.

After six months of consistent effort and growth, I feel ready to take the next step. Immensely thankful to this community for the feedback and support that has been so critical in getting me prepared.

A massive thank you to Oli, Toni and Jordan for making (F1rst Oracle Boxing) such an incredible community. Your coaching, verbal instant feedback, and genuine input has been beyond the best. Also, thank you to those of you who gave great feedback which meant a lot to me and thank you to those of you who were regulars on the live calls with me.

Thanks again for the encouragement, guidance, and inspiration you've provided. This community has been an essential part of my boxing journey, and I look forward to carrying everything I've learned into the next stage of my development."

"The Nervous System module was excellent. My key takeaways:
- Control your breathing to control your central nervous system (CNS).
- Breathing allows relaxation (or excitement), so controlling it is critical.
- Being relaxed allows you to perform better since relaxation removes tension.
- Tension strains your CNS and your muscles wearing you out faster and reducing your ability to whip your punches.
- Practice how you want to perform (practicing slow ingrains your CNS to perform slowly).
- Be deliberate with your technique because if you practice bad form that is how you are training your nervous system.
- Your CNS has around 30-60 minutes in the tank to perform best. If you keep pushing beyond that, and you are sluggish or your form and technique are sloppy, that is what you're ingraining into your CNS. End your sessions on a high note with perfect form."

"I decided to recommit to this community and engage more and I already feel like I made some breakthroughs on Toni and Ollie's zoom calls. I've gotta tip my hat to how effective you guys are at coaching in this format. I know you've put a lot of work in and it's inspiring to see the evolution. I feel like I gain a significantly better understanding of technique every time I make a call."
