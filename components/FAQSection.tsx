    question: "What is the 6-Week Challenge?",
    answer: "It's a 6-week online boxing program. You learn boxing basics through lessons and live coaching. When you finish, you get all your money back."
  },
  {
    question: "What do I get?",
    answer: `• Weekly live coaching calls with Oliver, Toni, and the Oracle team
• The Boxing Masterclass course
• The Oracle Boxing community on Skool
• Challenge Tracker to track your progress
• Help from other boxers doing the challenge`
  },
  {
    question: "What do I need to do to get my money back?",
    answer: `To get your refund, you must:

• Join 2 live calls each week (or watch recordings if you can't make it live)
• Send 1 training video each week for feedback
• Complete all 5 lessons of the Boxing Masterclass course
• Join your 2 check-in calls (one in the middle, one at the end)
• Show proof in the Challenge Tracker`
  },
  {
    question: "What if I can't join live calls because of my time zone?",
    answer: "No problem. You can watch the videos later and post what you learned. Just reply \"TZ\" to your welcome email and we'll show you how to get credit."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I miss a week?",
    answer: "You can catch up. As long as you finish everything by the end of the 6 weeks, you can still get your money back."
  },
  {
    question: "What stuff do I need?",
    answer: "Just your phone (to record videos) and boxing gear — gloves, hand wraps, and a bag or space to shadowbox. You don't need a gym."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I send videos?",
    answer: "Post your videos in the Video Feedback section each week. Our coaches and other members will watch them and help you get better."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is this for?",
    answer: `• People just starting boxing who want to learn the right way
• Boxers who feel stuck and want to get better
• Anyone who wants a clear plan to learn real boxing`
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to get my refund?",
    answer: "After you show us everything is done, we'll check it in 2-3 days. Then we'll send your money back in 1-2 weeks to the same way you paid."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't finish?",
    answer: "You still get to keep the course, community, and live calls for your 6 weeks — but you won't get your money back."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I keep going after the challenge?",
    answer: "Yes — most people join the Full Access Membership after they finish. That gives you more calls, harder training, and all our other programs."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get help?",
    answer: "Email team@oracleboxing.com or message us on Skool. We usually answer in 24 hours (Monday to Friday)."
