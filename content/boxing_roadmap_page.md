## Who This Is For

Boxing Roadmap is for:

You want to train the right way from day one. You value order, progress, and doing things properly.

You train alone, but you don’t want to guess. You need structure, direction, and drills that build real skill without a coach over your shoulder.

You’re preparing for sparring and want your foundation solid. Your technique clean, confident, and fight-ready.

## What You’ll Learn

1. Build technical form, clean mechanics, and control from the ground up.
2. Master defence and movement that keep you safe while staying sharp.
3. Develop explosive footwork that connects balance with power.
4. Blend attack, defence, and rhythm into one flowing style.

## Common Questions

**Q: How is the Roadmap different from BFFP?**\
A: BFFP explains the *why* — the system behind boxing. The Roadmap gives you the *how* — the drills, structure, and daily progression that make it real.

**Q: Do I need to complete the phases in order?**\
A: Yes. Each phase builds on the last to form a full skill set. You can revisit earlier phases anytime.

**Q: How long should I spend on each phase?**\
A: Most students spend 2–4 weeks per phase, depending on how often they train. Take your time—progress beats rushing.

**Q: Can I use this if I train at a gym?**\
A: Definitely. The Roadmap gives you structure and homework to complement your gym sessions.

**Q: What equipment do I need?**\
A: Gloves, hand wraps, and a heavy bag are ideal. But many drills can be done shadowboxing if needed.

**Q: Is it good prep for sparring?**\
A: Yes. By Phase V, you’ll be technically sharp, defensively sound, and confident under pressure.

**Q: Will I get updates?**\
A: Yes. All future updates and improvements are free. Lifetime access means you always have the latest version.
